Settings and defaults

The plugin currently doesn't work too well with tables (and I realize that that's a big usecase). It's all about the CSS. If you can provide a properly scaling block-level container (= "not a table"), then you should be good to go. *CSS is your friend.*

## Warning!

The plugin is currently merely an experiment on how to provide fast and responsive truncation. When using it e.g. with bigger font sizes you will most likely encounter issues.
I can't promise that these issues will be covercome. Too many variables: browsers, fonts, sizes, kerning, spacing, â€¦
